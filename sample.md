Yes, exactly! The LangChain community **removed the predefined memory types** because:  

1. **All other memory types (like ConversationSummaryMemory, EntityMemory, etc.) can be implemented using just these two:**
   - **Ephemeral Memory** (short-term, session-based)
   - **Persistent Memory** (long-term, vector store-based)

2. **Developers have different needs**, so instead of forcing a fixed structure, LangChain now provides a **flexible framework** (via LangGraph) to implement **custom memory solutions**.

3. **It improves performance** by letting developers optimize memory updates rather than relying on built-in implementations that may not fit all use cases.

### **ðŸ”¹ How Can Other Memory Types Be Recreated?**
Since LangChain now only provides **basic state management**, you can manually implement any memory type:

| **Old Memory Type**                | **How to Implement Now**  |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **ConversationBufferMemory** (stores full chat history) | Store messages in a **Python list or database** (session memory). |
| **ConversationBufferWindowMemory** (stores last N messages) | Store only the **last N messages in a list** before discarding older ones. |
| **ConversationSummaryMemory** (stores summarized chat history) | Use an **LLM to update a summary string** instead of storing full chat logs. |
| **ConversationEntityMemory** (tracks named entities) | Use an **LLM or database** to extract and store entity-related data. |

### **ðŸ”¹ Why Did LangChain Remove These Memory Types?**
âœ… **Flexibility:** Developers can now create their own **custom memory logic** instead of using predefined versions.  
âœ… **Performance:** The old system often **called LLMs inefficiently**, making apps slower and costlier.  
âœ… **Scalability:** By removing fixed memory types, LangChain allows **more advanced state handling** (like multi-user memory).  
âœ… **Encourages Best Practices:** Forces developers to **think about when/how to call LLMs** instead of always relying on automatic memory.

### **ðŸ”¹ TL;DR**
- **Yes, all memory types can now be implemented manually.**  
- **LangChain removed them to give developers more control & efficiency.**  
- **You now have to manage summarization, entity tracking, and message storage yourself.**  

Would you like a **ready-to-use template** for building different memory types in the new system? ðŸš€
